<p>The award was granted for the ICF's contribution to standardizing Information Cards as a core technology for the future of identity management.

<p>"On behalf of the Information Card Foundation, I want to thank Kuppinger Cole and the EIC for this honor", said Drummond Reed, ICF Executive Director. "The purpose of ICF is to bring an open community together to advance Information Card standards, implementations, and practices around the world, and this is a sign we are making real progress."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kuppingercole.com/">Kuppinger Cole</a> also issued every registered user of the EIC conference a managed Information Card that can be used to enter the conference portal at <a href="http://www.kuppingercole.com/" title="www.kuppingercole.com">www.kuppingercole.com</a>. These cards were issued using the <a href="../../../card-projects/webcard-loyalty/">Webcard Loyalty</a> portal service provided by ICF member <a href="http://www.fun.de/">fun communications</a>.</p>
<p>The EIC also hosted in the inaugural meeting of the <a href="http://informationcard.de/">German Chapter of the ICF</a>. Further reporting on that meeting will be posted once the EIC has concluded.</p>

    <p><strong>SPECIAL TO RSA-San Francisco-April 20, 2009-</strong>The <a href="../../index/">Information Card Foundation (ICF)</a> announced today the first seven Information Card projects to be featured on the new ICF website. The new site will be unveiled at a presentation at the RSA Security conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco today. The announcement will be part of the <em>Harnessing the Power of Digital Identity</em> workshop the ICF is co-sponsoring with the <a href="http://www.projectliberty.org/">Liberty Alliance</a> on Monday, April 20. The presentation will be held at 2:15 p.m. at Esplanades 301&amp;303 ("Purple 301&amp;303"), Moscone Center.</p>
<p>The seven projects are actual examples of how the Information Card ecosystem simplifies and standardizes identity-based transactions regardless of the site, domain, application, or information involved.</p>
<p>"Just as people needed to first see a Web browser to understand what it could do, now they need to see an Information Card selector to understand its potential," said <a href="../../press-contacts/">Drummond Reed, Interim Executive Director of the ICF</a>. "Information cards have moved beyond theory to solve real-world challenges."</p>
<p><a href="../../quick-overview/">Information Cards</a> bring a familiar offline paradigm-the cards you carry in your wallet-to the online world. They work with a new software tool called a <a href="../../selectors/"><em>selector</em> </a>that operates as an extension to your Web browser. Selectors are available today from ICF members <a href="http://www.azigo.com/">Azigo</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a>, as well as from several open source projects.</p>

    <p><strong>SPECIAL TO RSA-San Francisco-April 20, 2009-</strong>At the RSA Security conference beginning today at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, the <a href="../../index/">Information Card Foundation (ICF)</a> announced publication of a new white paper on Information Cards by noted industry analyst Craig Burton. <a href="../../white-papers/ecosystem/"><em>The Information Card Ecosystem: The Fundamental Leap from Cookies and Passwords to Cards and Selectors</em></a> explains why the Information Card metaphor is being recognized across the industry as the future of digital identity both in the enterprise and on the Internet.</p>
<p>"This is the first analysis of digital identity that explains why <a href="../../quick-overview/">Information Cards</a> are an inevitable next step in the evolution of relationships on the Internet, just as cookies were in the 1990's," said Mr. Burton, principal analyst at Burtonian and former CTO of Novell. "Cookies solved the problem of how a user could share information across the pages of the same website. For example, without them, e-commerce shopping carts would not work. Information Cards solve the next wider problem: how a user can safely share private information across completely <em>different</em> websites of their choosing."</p>
<p>The paper uses the common example of booking travel. Today, a traveller must re-enter their trip details into every travel site they visit. Even though that travel site may set a cookie to recognize the returning user, that's all the cookie can "remember". With Information Cards, the traveller will be able enter the trip details once, then use an Information Card to securely and privately share it with each travel site they wish in one click.</p>

    <p>The Information Card Foundation announced today that Charles Andres, Executive Director of the Foundation for its first 18 months, is stepping down to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Andres states, &ldquo;My goal was to get the Foundation off the ground with the critical mass of high-quality individuals and companies needed for success. Having achieved that, it is time for me to move beyond the neutral role of Executive Director. The global business opportunities for Information Cards touch every market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under his tenure, the ICF grew to 35 member companies, established five working groups, and developed the ICF Claims Catalog. Mr. Andres was also instrumental in organizing the <em>Harnessing the Power of Digital Identity</em> seminar to be held <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2009/us/agenda-and-sessions/pre-conference-education/monday-seminars.htm">April 20 at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco</a>, which the ICF is co-sponsoring.</p>
<p>ICF board member Drummond Reed is taking a leave of absence from the board to assume the role of Interim Executive Director. A founder of Cordance Corporation, former VP Infrastructure at Parity Communications, co-chair of the XRI and XDI Technical Committees at OASIS, and a founding board member of the OpenID Foundation and XDI.org, Mr. Reed has been involved in Internet identity infrastructure and services for over 15 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to quickly building on the foundation Charles and the ICF founding members have established. Information Cards, selectors, and the Identity Metasystem represent an opportunity for convergence across all Internet identity protocols; the faster we can foster adoption the sooner we will harvest the personal, social, and commercial benefits of a ubiquitous Internet identity layer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Reed can be contacted in his new role at <strong>director </strong>---@--- <strong>informationcard.net</strong>.</p>

    <p>The prospect of digital identity working at Internet scale&mdash;and Internet strength&mdash;has occupied the attention of many in the industry for the better part of a decade. Perhaps that should come as no surprise&mdash;cross-domain authentication and authorization has long been one of the thorniest problems in networking. Blow it up to Internet size&mdash;and add the Internet&rsquo;s staggering diversity&mdash;and even Don Quixote might start looking for a more possible dream.</p>
<p>Yet twice before the Net has beaten such interoperability odds. It owes its very existence to a no-frills internetworking protocol&mdash;TCP/IP&mdash;emerging from a thick protocol soup to become a lingua franca of packets. Less than two decades later another minimalist approach&mdash;HTML&mdash;turned the universe of information into a World Wide Web by giving us a universal way to link content.Could there be a hat trick for the Internet identity layer? And if so, what&rsquo;s under the hat?</p>
<p>When I first started reading about Information Cards in <a href="http://www.identityblog.com/">Kim Cameron&rsquo;s</a> blog posts in 2004, it was a disarmingly simple metaphor: no more than the online equivalent of the cards we carry in our wallets to prove our identity and use for transactions every day. Could such electronic cards really be the key to an &ldquo;<a href="http://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/07/05/IdentityMetasystem.htm">identity metasystem</a>&rdquo; that can bridge security and privacy domains the same way Web pages bridged content domains?</p>

<ul>
<li> locate a password that I had not used in 2 months.</li>
<li> create 2 new usernames and new passwords for 2 websites, filling out the usual form with name, address, email address, phone number, credit card number, expiration date, secret card code, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all of us  the Internet has been a wonderful transformational experience.  Information at your fingertips, as Bill Gates famously said, has changed our lives.  We can comparison shop, buy custom products, find hard-to-find replacement parts, locate nearly any book or record we ever wanted to own, provide feedback on products and services, get answers to almost any question, etc.   My kids can't imagine life without it.</p>
<p>But the Internet wasn't originally designed to handle every economic or social transaction,  or the need to prove you are you, or the claims you make.   Today we need this capability.</p>
