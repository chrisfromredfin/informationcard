 <title>Mary Ruddy Appointed Interim Executive Director of ICF</title>
 <link>http://informationcard.net/blog/mary-ruddy-appointed-exec-director</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m pleased  to announce that as of October 1, Mary is the new Executive Director of ICF. Mary brings a  wealth of experience and relationships within user-centric identity  community. Having worked alongside Mary in a number of settings, I have  every confidence that she&#039;ll guide the ICF admirably as we begin our  next phase of growth and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary  succeeds Drummond Reed, another person well known in the identity community.  Drummond&#039;s passion for building standards, trust frameworks, and  supporting organizations within what might be called the emerging &lt;em&gt;Personal Data Ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; has grown to the point where several weeks ago he told the ICF board  that he wanted to focus on it full time and that we should initiate a  search for his successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  February 2009 Drummond was asked by this board on rather short notice  if he would serve as our E.D. He cheerfully accepted and immediately  tackled the considerable challenge of getting the new ICF website,  communications strategy, and organizational infrastructure ready for the  successful launch at RSA several weeks later. Since then Drummond has  continued to do an exemplary job promoting the cause of Information  Cards in countless public and private venues. He has also devoted a  significant portion of his time to co-founding, in partnership with the  OpenID Foundation, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openidentityexchange.org/&quot;&gt;OIX &lt;/a&gt;organization.  Drummond also worked alongside Mary Ruddy, John Bradley and other ICF board  members to get Information Card technology to be accepted by the US ICAM  program. All of these projects have been successful in no small part  due to Drummond&#039;s tireless efforts, and have benefited from his  professional manner and genuine enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Paul Trevithick, ICF Board Chair&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ICF Executive Director Transition</title>
 <link>http://informationcard.net/blog/icf-exec-director-transition-2009-03</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Information Card Foundation announced today that Charles Andres, Executive Director of the Foundation for its first 18 months, is stepping down to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Andres states, &amp;ldquo;My goal was to get the Foundation off the ground with the critical mass of high-quality individuals and companies needed for success. Having achieved that, it is time for me to move beyond the neutral role of Executive Director. The global business opportunities for Information Cards touch every market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under his tenure, the ICF grew to 35 member companies, established five working groups, and developed the ICF Claims Catalog. Mr. Andres was also instrumental in organizing the &lt;em&gt;Harnessing the Power of Digital Identity&lt;/em&gt; seminar to be held &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rsaconference.com/2009/us/agenda-and-sessions/pre-conference-education/monday-seminars.htm&quot;&gt;April 20 at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, which the ICF is co-sponsoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICF board member Drummond Reed is taking a leave of absence from the board to assume the role of Interim Executive Director. A founder of Cordance Corporation, former VP Infrastructure at Parity Communications, co-chair of the XRI and XDI Technical Committees at OASIS, and a founding board member of the OpenID Foundation and XDI.org, Mr. Reed has been involved in Internet identity infrastructure and services for over 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I look forward to quickly building on the foundation Charles and the ICF founding members have established. Information Cards, selectors, and the Identity Metasystem represent an opportunity for convergence across all Internet identity protocols; the faster we can foster adoption the sooner we will harvest the personal, social, and commercial benefits of a ubiquitous Internet identity layer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Reed can be contacted in his new role at &lt;strong&gt;director &lt;/strong&gt;---@--- &lt;strong&gt;informationcard.net&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
